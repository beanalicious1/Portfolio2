    <p>You're tired. Stressed out. You've been hitting the books hard and the bottle harder. Your life is miserable. </p>

<p class="block">Jim from Scranton, PA says:</p>
<blockquote>My corporate job was really getting to me. I mean, yeah, I was hitting it off with the receptionist, and I have a love/hate thing going on with my co-workers, but...I kept on daydreaming about eloping to Niagara Falls and pawning off my web development duties to someone else! Thanks Dan, Your next batch of paper is on me.</blockquote>

<p class="block">Dr. Jonathan Zoidberg says:</p>
<blockquote>I was getting tired of being cooped in my doctor's practice. So I said take a scuttle, why not? Letting Dan take care of all my web development needs let me take a trip to Atlanta, I even found some real estate I wanted to move to! In the words of my people, Woop woopwoop woop woop woop!</blockquote>

<p>
    Your desire for a cheap and quick website is my bread and butter. Why should you have to pay for someone experienced, when I can do sorta the same thing at a little less cost?! You'd be crazy not to go for the cost effective option! Don't be crazy!
<p>Thank you so much for giving me a visit</p>
